Example Summary
------------------
This application runs through a set of common SYS/BIOS APIs in order to
measure, in CPU cycles, each of thier prospective execution times.

Example Usage
---------------
Run the application, the corresponding minimum, maximum and average execution
API execution times will be printed to the console.

Application Design Details
------------------------
The SYS/BIOS objects used within the application are constructed within
main(), prior to start of the BIOS scheduler. The set of APIs to be tested are
run within the benchmarkTask where each individual function is called
multiple times in order to measure the aforementioned min, max and average
execution times.

Notes
------
These benchmarks are target specific, please see the corresponding
configuration file benchloop.cfg for the specific settings used.

For more debugging information such as the CPU and timestamp frequencies used
during the tests set the USERDEBUG flag to 1.

In order to record accurate Kernel timing data, the TIRTOS driver and
middleware components have been excluded from this example.

Note: For IAR users using any SensorTag(STK) Board, the XDS110 debugger must be
selected with the 4-wire JTAG connection within your projects' debugger
configuration.
